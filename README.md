# LIRI-node-app

LIRI is similar to SIRI, sans speech recognition. Maybe later.

Try it out.

Enter one of the following commands in the command line:
* my-tweets
* spotify-this-song (enter your favorite song, mine is 'Barbie Girl' by Aqua!)
* movie-this (enter your favorite movie)
* do-what-it-says

my-tweets will return 20 of my most recent tweets.

spotify-this-song will return information on the song of your choosing.

movie-this will return information on the movie of your choosing.

do-what-it-says will read directly from the random.txt file.

And the cherry on top--not only will LIRI track the output directly in the terminal/bash window, the data will be appended to the log.txt file!
